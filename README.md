## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset consists of a diverse set of high-resolution leaf images labeled with disease names. It has been preprocessed and augmented for better generalization.

> If you're using your own dataset, ensure it follows the standard folder structure:
```

## 🏗️ How the Model Works

1. **Image Preprocessing** – Resize, normalize, and augment images.
2. **CNN Architecture** – Custom model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers.
3. **Training** – Uses categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and visual predictions.
